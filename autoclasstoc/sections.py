class Section:
    """
    Format a specific section in a class TOC, e.g. "Public Methods".

    The purpose of this class is to make it easy to customize the sections that 
    make up the class TOC.  For example, you might want an "Event Handler" 
    section that includes any method that starts with "on\\_".  Or you might 
    want to format the links in a table with multiple columns, to save more 
    space.  

    These kinds of things can be accomplished by subclassing `Section` and 
    overwriting the relevant methods.  Almost every method is meant to be 
    overridden by subclasses, but most subclasses will only need to override 
    `key`, `title`, and `predicate`.  `key` and `title` have no default value, 
    and must be overridden in each subclass.  `predicate` determines which 
    attributes are included in the section, which is the primary purpose of 
    most custom sections.
